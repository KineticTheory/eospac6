SUBJECT: EOSPAC 6.5.0alpha.1 is released
DATE:    January 17, 2021
SYMBOL:  n/a

EOSPAC 6.5.0alpha.1 has been released for general use. This is a limited release because it has not
been deployed for all possible available compilers on the various LANL and LLNL systems. Rather
this release is targeted for the IBM XL compilers on available powerpc clusters: RZAnsel at LLNL,
Sierra at LLNL, and Darwin-Power9 at LANL.

The following changes have been implemented since the release of EOSPAC 6.5.0alpha:

High Priority:
* Some SESAME ascii files cannot be read (#676)
* Incorrect _eos_splunk implementation in custom eos_version_name_* (#663)
* Fatal seg fault has recurred for Trinitite KNL compilation (#660)

Normal Priority:
* Fix test030 failure on capulin (#679)
* Fix test_getAllMaterials failure on capulin (#678)
* Tests failing on trinititie when using -O (#677)
* Fix memory issues in eos_GpuOffloadDataEosDataMap (#670)
* Fix labeling in test_artf11602 and test_artf11602_se stdout (#669)
* Clean up code prior to merge !26 (#667)
* generate_Log10DistributedPoints numerical sensitivities cause platform-specific problems (#666)
* Fix scripts/compile_and_run_tests_on_slurm_node.sbatch script (#662)
* Repair TCL module script for Lmod nuance (#661)
* Add more tests to skip_extrap branch (#658)
* Update test descriptions for new tests (#657)
* Cross-platform testing of skip_extrap branch (#656)
* Fix makefiles on multiple branches (#652)
* Implement an EOSPAC 6 options key/value configuration file (#38)

More details are forthcoming with the next release of EOSPAC 6.5.0beta -- a date is yet to be determined.

The most current user manual is distributed with the library on the various platforms.
